# pdxdb
An open collection of patient derived xenograft tumor models. 

The database structure is designed to conform to the [PDX minimal-information standard](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092942/), to allow the owner of a PDX model to submit all necessary or desired information.

The website uses Django for the backend and includes an API via REST framework. The frontend is currently Bootsrap 5 but could be rebuilt with React or another framework at a later date since an API is already available.
